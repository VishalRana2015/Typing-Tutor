So far, you have only typed lowercase letters. In this
lesson, you will learn how to capatilize letters with
the shift keys.
Capital letters are typed using both hands, one for the
shift key and the other for the letter key. You need to
press the Shift key at the same time as the letter you
want to capatilize.
The Shift keys are always pressed with your little fingers.
