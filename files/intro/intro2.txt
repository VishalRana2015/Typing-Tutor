Next you will learn the keys E and I,
located above the home row, on the "extensio" row.
E and I are typed using the middle fingers.
You will notice that when you reach for E and I
with your middle finger, other fingers automaticaly
mimic their movement and straighten out a little bit.
This is a natural movement and you don't need
to resist it. However, do try to keep the movement
as small as possible.
Be sure to return your fingers to their
home row.
