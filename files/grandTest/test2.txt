Yosemite National Park is located in the Sierra Nevada
Mountains of central California, a setting so spectacular
and awe-inspiring that John Muir, a naturalist and the
Sierra Club founder, called it "a landscape ... that after
all my wanderings still appears as the most beautiful I
have ever beheld."
Over millions of yeas earthquakes, glaciers and other
forces of nature have left indelible footprints on this
landscape, footprints that are still visible in the
towering granite cliffs, thundering waterfalls, steep
mountains, and deep alpine lakes, and they all beckon
visitors to explore, climb, photograph, and experience
their granderu.
